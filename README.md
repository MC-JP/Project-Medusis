Who are the users of the product?  
Internet users for entertainment.

What are their needs?  
They want to see the use of creative foul language.

What is the context?  
There exist extensions for browsers, which filter profanities. We want to do the opposite.

Formulate Strategy:  
-Research if it is doable;  
-The prototype would be just a programme, which inserts swear words in text files and not on browsers yet;
